Hi, I'm Lyzi.

<!-- ![lyzi](/images/lyzi.jpg) -->

I'm a documentation engineer and technical writer with experience in developer relations, software engineering, geospatial technology, product support and enablement, and community management. My career has taken many different turns, but for the most part I've spent the last 15 years focused on helping people learn and grow. I believe that writing clearly is difficult, but well worth the effort. **Words are work, but it's important work.**

## about this site

This site has a blog, my resume, and a portfolio.

I built it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It uses the [no-style-please](https://github.com/hanwenguo/hugo-theme-nostyleplease) theme and the [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color palette. I added a theme switcher, too: the button in the top left corner will toggle between light and dark mode.
