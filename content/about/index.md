**Hi! I'm Lyzi.**

I'm a documentation engineer and technical writer with experience in developer relations, software engineering, geospatial technology, product support and enablement, and community management.

My career has taken many different turns, but in every role I've been focused on explaining things clearly to help people learn and grow. I believe writing well is difficult, but worth the effort.

**I am currently looking for a job!** Update on what I'm looking for coming soon, but it's basically technical writer/content engineer roles.

In my non-computer life, I enjoy playing music (handbells/bass), making art (drawing/knitting), and watching football (Oregon Ducks/Buffalo Bills/I'll watch basically any football game tbh).

### colophon

I built this website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It uses a modified version of the [no-style-please](https://github.com/hanwenguo/hugo-theme-nostyleplease) theme and the [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color palette. I added a theme switcher, too: the button in the top left corner will toggle between light and dark mode. (I personally like light mode better because it's the theme I use for my text editor but I'm not the boss of you do what feels right.)
