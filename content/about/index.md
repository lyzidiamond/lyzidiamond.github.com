Hi, I'm Lyzi.

{{< optimg-page src="lyzi.jpg" width="300" alt="Lyzi" >}}

I'm a documentation engineer and technical writer with experience in developer relations, software engineering, geospatial technology, product support and enablement, and community management.

I belive that **words are work**, but it's important work. I've spent my career focused on using clear communication to engage and educate anyone who wants to learn.

My career has taken many different turns, but throughout the last 15 years focused on explaining things clearly to help people learn and grow. I believe writing well is difficult, but worth the effort. **Words are work, but it's important work.**

In my non-computer life, I enjoy playing music, making art, and watching football.

## about this site

This site has my blog, my resume, my portfolio, and an archive of old projects and ephemera.

I built this website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It uses a modified version of the [no-style-please](https://github.com/hanwenguo/hugo-theme-nostyleplease) theme and the [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color palette. I added a theme switcher, too: the button in the top left corner will toggle between light and dark mode.
