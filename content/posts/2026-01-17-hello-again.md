**Well hello there.** It's been a while. It's nice to see you. It's nice to be back.

This is 

I want to talk a little bit about what's been going on with me since I last wrote here, and then I want to share some stuff I'm learning while rebuilding my website with Hugo. These should probably be separate blog posts, but we're working on not making the "perfect" the enemy of the "done" right now and this feels like good practice.

## what's been going on with me

Feel free to skip this next section if you want, it's mostly about feelings/trying to explain why I've been absent for so long/an update on my life these past nine years.

_TL;DR: In 2017 I started getting hardcore burnout. I tried to get out of it a bunch of ways that didn't work, then COVID happened, then my dad got sick. Now I'm trying to pick back up some of the things I've put down, which is hard but important. My "old self" is gone but my new self is also good and can do things._

<!-- My last blog post was in May 2017, almost a full nine years ago. Back then I was working at Mapbox, steeped in supporting users trying to make maps work on computers. I was also coming off of managing Maptime, an organization I was proud to co-found and run but that ultimately ended up running me. I was exhausted. I was burned out. And that burnout put me in a rough emotional place -- I was transitioning from moving forward at breakneck speed to succumbing to the fact that I needed rest._(1)_

This was a hard transition for me. I have historically put so much value on my output as a proxy for self-worth and meaning, and that feeling still lingers today (though not nearly as much -- getting older is fun like that). I moved away from speaking in public and started a new role at Mapbox as a software engineer. I worked with a great team and learned a lot and got to work on navigation and directions (which is very cool and at some point I'll write about routing engines because they're awesome). I spoke at some other conferences after that, but my public speaking run was definitely winding down. I was still exhausted and frustrated with my lack of motivation.

So I left Mapbox in 2018 and ended up moving out of the mapping industry to do developer relations at Glitch (RIP), where I did write a lot of blog posts, just not here. While I thought becoming more public-facing again would get me out of my funk, it turns out devrel is not great for living with burnout -- one of the de facto metrics of success is how many people know who you are, and meeting new people is exhausting.

But I was committed to pushing through and getting back to my "old self". In mid-2019 I moved to New York to work in office with my coworkers. It definitely helped, but I found myself gravitating away from attending events and speaking and more towards writing. Turns out being public-facing wasn't changing my energy.

At the end of 2019 I left Glitch to lead documentation at Heroku. Throughout my career I've always most enjoyed helping people learn, and documentation felt like a great way to reach a lot of people at once while not having to keep track of my Twitter follower count. I started at Heroku in February 2020. Then in March... well, you know. Talk about a destabilizing event! Work was good and I was enjoying writing and editing, but the world was starting to get a lot more difficult and exhausting. I was searching for meaning, as we all were and have been since. (The world is still difficult and exhausting and is getting moreso all the time.)

A year later, in March 2021, my dad was diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer. He passed away in October 2022. If you've lost someone close to you, you know how it forces you to look at the world differently. You also know how grief can sap all of your energy in ways you don't expect it to, at random times and in odd circumstances and inconvenient situations. Once again, I shut down. And then I started judging myself for it. I knew I was capable of so much and I wanted to do more. I started judging myself again for the previous years, for not keeping my output high. That judgment held me down and prevented me from 

At this point I had transitioned from Heroku to Salesforce proper and fortunately they were very cool about the whole situation and gave me a lot of support.

It's been three years since he died. My grief isn't gone, but it is changing all the time.

_1. Using em-dashes (or the two-dash equivalent) makes me nervous now because people view it as an indicator that the writer used generative AI. I promise I wrote this myself! I just like em-dashes!_ -->
