- Why I did it
  - ruby dependency hell (as a non-ruby developer)
  - jekyll not supported in ruby 4
- What's good
  - themes as submodules + overrides in the top level
- What's annoying
  - learning a new syntax
	- toml? but that may just be because of the theme
- pitfalls/mistakes/difficulties converting from jekyll
	- editing the theme itself
	- 


- what i like about it
- what i needed to convert from jekyll
