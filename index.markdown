# Hi! My name is Lyzi Diamond.

<p class="description">I'm a documentation engineer and technical writer based in Brooklyn, NY.</p>

I like maps, teaching, playing handbells, watching football (Go Ducks! Go Bills!), making art, and going to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

<span class="important">I am currently looking for a new job.</span> I'm open to contract and full time technical writing/documentation engineer gigs with a preference for working on API and developer docs, content strategy, information architecture, and knowledge management. Check out my [resume]() and [reach out]() if you wanna chat more.
