  <h2>Hi! My name is Lyzi Diamond.</h2>
  
  <p>I do a lot of things. Recently I've been thinking about documentation, knitting, 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I make <strong>maps</strong> and teach people about maps</li>
    <li>I write, edit, and build <strong>technical documentation</strong></li>
    <li><strong>developer relations</strong>, speaking at conferences, creating tutorials, writing blog posts</li>
    <li>knitting! (new hobby as of May 2020, very exciting)</li>
    <li>playing music! (I'm in a band, when we record stuff I'll probably link to it here)</li>
  </ul>
  
 <p>Currently I work at Salesforce as editor of the <a href='https://devcenter.heroku.com'>Heroku Dev Center</a>.</p>
  
  <p>This website has a bunch of old content that I'd like to remove/update as needed. Those links are still out there and if you come upon them, they will lead you to where you want to go.</p>
  
  <small>This website was last updated in March 2021.</small>
