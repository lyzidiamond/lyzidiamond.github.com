        <h3>It's Really Bad</h3>
        <h4>To the tune of "Since U Been Gone" by Kelly Clarkson</h4>

<p>Here's the thing, we all like bread<br />
  But this week we eat matzah instead<br />
  Yeah yeah, it's not the best<br />
  The Jews escaped, we had to run<br />
  Couldn't wait for a loaf or bun<br />
  Yeah yeah, no yeast around</p>
        
<p>And every year you hear me say<br />
  That it's important to the Jews<br />
  But you also have to hear me say</p>


<p>It's really bad<br />
They ate it in Egypt cuz they had to<br />
It's tasteless and bland, yeah yeah<br />
At least we<br />
get to drink<br />
four cups of wine<br />
Matzah's the worst</p>

<p>
It tastes like crap, like crumbly chalk<br />
Instead of hamotzi I'll take a walk<br />
Yeah yeah, it's really bad<br />
We take a piece, we break it in half<br />
We hide a bit but why not the whole stack<br />
Yeah yeah, afikomen plus
</p>

<p>
I've tried it in a lot of ways<br />
With chocolate and caramel<br />
But still I feel I gotta say<br />
</p>

<p>It's really bad<br />
  They ate it in Egypt cuz they had to<br />
  It's tasteless and bland, yeah yeah<br />
  At least we<br />
  get to drink<br />
  four cups of wine<br />
  Matzah's the worst</p>

<p>Give me a chance to chew it<br />
So it won't get stuck in my throat<br />
It's really gross I just can't take it<br />
At least we can eat bread again in eight days</p>

<p>It's really bad<br />
  They ate it in Egypt cuz they had to<br />
  It's tasteless and bland, yeah yeah<br />
  At least we<br />
  get to drink<br />

      <h3>Bye Bye Bye (Pharaoh)</h3>
      <h4>To the tune of "Bye Bye Bye" by *NSYNC</h4>
      
      <p>I'm telling you tonight<br />
Hey, Pharaoh better make this right<br />
Before there ain't no light, hey Rammie come on<br />
God's gonna send his plagues<br />
And you'll wish you had ruled our way<br />
And let the Jews get all our stuff and be gone</p>

<p>We know that we can't take no more<br />
You've made us cry<br />
So we're going to leave this land<br />
Pharaoh bye bye bye (bye bye!)</p>

<p>Don't wanna be a slave for you<br />
Just another workhorse on this pyramid crew<br />
You may argue but it ain't no lie<br />
Pharaoh bye bye bye (bye bye!)<br />
You really wanna let us go<br />
Before the blood and locusts and cows go loco<br />
Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie<br />
Pharaoh bye bye bye (bye bye!)</p>

<p>Let's start off with some blood<br />
Then maybe we'll add in some frogs<br />
I hope you've got a lice pick or specialty soap<br />
How about a swarm of flies<br />
Followed by a little livestock plague<br />
Be sure to grab a jacket before it hails</p>

<p>We can't forget the locust crowd<br />
And the dark all day<br />
Then the Jews put blood on their front doors<br />
So their sons were okay (bye bye!)</p>

<p>
It's really time to let us leave<br />
Your firstborns are dead and everyone's peeved<br />
We are over this and you know why<br />
Pharaoh bye bye bye (bye bye!)<br />
You're really gonna chase us down?<br />
We'll part the sea and make all your men drown<br />
We are leaving hear our battle cry<br />
Pharaoh bye bye bye (bye bye!)<br />
