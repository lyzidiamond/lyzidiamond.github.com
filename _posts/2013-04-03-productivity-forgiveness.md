title: The Secret To Productivity? Forgiveness.
category: posts
---


I have often been given the advice, "Don't try to do everything. You will never succeed. Instead, try to do one or two things at a time, really well."

I have also been given the advice, "Don't succumb to fear of missing out. Whatever you're imagining is probably ten times cooler than what's actually going on."

But still, I find myself committing to everything and actually doing nothing because I don't know what to prioritize. And it sucks.

Take, for example, this website. I made it in two days when I was visiting the east coast during a horrendous cold snap this January. Since then there have been no blog posts, no maintenance. I have learned so much about HTML and CSS since then, and yet I haven't put any of it into practice.

Why? Because I'm paralyzed. I have seventeen different things pulling my attention at any given moment, and it is impossible to focus on any one of them at a given time. There's a little voice telling me in the back of my head that I should be doing something else, that something else is more important. So I don't do anything at all, because I can't decide what it is that I should do.

On the rare occasion that I can bring myself to do something, I am not actually thinking about whatever I'm doing; I'm thinking about all of the things I'm not doing and should be doing. Paralysis.

I have been introspecting and meditating on this for a while. I've been trying to figure out why it is that I feel so guilty all the time, why I feel like I need to do things in a specific order or I'm doing it wrong. The answer is convoluted, but ultimately I have found that I hold myself to an impossibly high standard. The need for order in a mind that is predisposed to chaos is another way that I can move the goalposts and never be satisfied.

In light of that, I have decided to set some simple goals for myself. The individual tasks are irrelevant, because they all center around the same thing: **forgiveness**. I need to forgive myself. Since I've started forgiving myself, I have actually gotten things done. I've figured out the things I like to do and the things I'd rather not do (there's always the stuff you _have_ to do regardless of whether or not you want to, but that's irrelevant here). And I have on the whole felt better.

Forgiveness also means removing the "should" from my internal dialogue and focusing instead on the "want." _Forget what you **should** do,_ I tell myself. _What do you **want** to do?_ The answers didn't surprise me, but the way I have felt after acting on them was certainly startling.

This is still hard for me. I am still trying to navigate using this new compass. But I'm hoping that with some work, dedication, and practice, it will lead me to places previously thought unreachable.
