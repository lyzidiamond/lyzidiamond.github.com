Today on [its blog](http://www.mapbox.com/blog/geojsonio-announce/), the open-source geo wizard repository [MapBox](http://mapbox.com/) has announced a new project to create, share, and edit geospatial data in your browser. It’s called [geojson.io](http://geojson.io), and it’s set to sweep the nation! Or at least, the nation of those who like creating, sharing and editing spatial data.

As far as I can tell, the product (so far) has the following features:

* Draw points, lines, or polygons on the Leaflet map and receive GeoJSON output
* Edit data attributes in table or JSON format
* Edit GeoJSON files and gists containing GeoJSON from [GitHub repositories](http://giscollective.org/github-and-geojson-just-keeps-getting-better/)
* Upload a file in one several formats for conversion to GeoJSON*

There is also a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geojsonio/oibjgofbhldcajfamjganpeacipebckp) (for all you [GitHub](http://github.com) users out there) that adds a button to GitHub repos and gists containing geojson for easy editing in geojson.io. This has huge implications for data collaboration; the two datasets mentioned in the MapBox post are [bars that have free wi-fi](https://github.com/benbalter/dc-wifi-social) (currently a Washington, DC-focused dataset) and [favorite running routes](http://geojson.io/#gist:6188907). The possibilities are endless! What data will you create?

The project is open source, which means that anyone can add to it and help make it better! To contribute, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson.io) and have at it. Remember: with open source, no contribution is too small!
