  <p>I have often been given the advice, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to do everything. You will never succeed. Instead, try to do one or two things at a time, really well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have also been given the advice, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t succumb to fear of missing out. Whatever you&rsquo;re imagining is probably ten times cooler than what&rsquo;s actually going on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But still, I find myself committing to everything and actually doing nothing because I don&rsquo;t know what to prioritize. And it sucks.</p>

<p>Take, for example, this website. I made it in two days when I was visiting the east coast during a horrendous cold snap this January. Since then there have been no blog posts, no maintenance. I have learned so much about HTML and CSS since then, and yet I haven&rsquo;t put any of it into practice.</p>

<p>Why? Because I&rsquo;m paralyzed. I have seventeen different things pulling my attention at any given moment, and it is impossible to focus on any one of them at a given time. There&rsquo;s a little voice telling me in the back of my head that I should be doing something else, that something else is more important. So I don&rsquo;t do anything at all, because I can&rsquo;t decide what it is that I should do.</p>

<p>On the rare occasion that I can bring myself to do something, I am not actually thinking about whatever I&rsquo;m doing; I&rsquo;m thinking about all of the things I&rsquo;m not doing and should be doing. Paralysis.</p>

<p>I have been introspecting and meditating on this for a while. I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure out why it is that I feel so guilty all the time, why I feel like I need to do things in a specific order or I&rsquo;m doing it wrong. The answer is convoluted, but ultimately I have found that I hold myself to an impossibly high standard. The need for order in a mind that is predisposed to chaos is another way that I can move the goalposts and never be satisfied.</p>

<p>In light of that, I have decided to set some simple goals for myself. The individual tasks are irrelevant, because they all center around the same thing: <strong>forgiveness</strong>. I need to forgive myself. Since I&rsquo;ve started forgiving myself, I have actually gotten things done. I&rsquo;ve figured out the things I like to do and the things I&rsquo;d rather not do (there&rsquo;s always the stuff you <em>have</em> to do regardless of whether or not you want to, but that&rsquo;s irrelevant here). And I have on the whole felt better.</p>

<p>Forgiveness also means removing the &ldquo;should&rdquo; from my internal dialogue and focusing instead on the &ldquo;want.&rdquo; <em>Forget what you <strong>should</strong> do,</em> I tell myself. <em>What do you <strong>want</strong> to do?</em> The answers didn&rsquo;t surprise me, but the way I have felt after acting on them was certainly startling.</p>

<p>This is still hard for me. I am still trying to navigate using this new compass. But I&rsquo;m hoping that with some work, dedication, and practice, it will lead me to places previously thought unreachable.</p>
